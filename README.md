# GravityWarriors üåü

GravityWarriors is a Django-based web application designed for our calisthenics team. The platform serves as a centralized hub to showcase team member profiles and maintain a **scoreboard** for the most impressive **weighted Dips** and **Pull-ups** achievements. The app ensures smooth functionality for managing users and their performance records while supporting add, edit, and delete actions with proper permissions.
