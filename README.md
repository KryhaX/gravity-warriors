# GravityWarriors 🌟

GravityWarriors is a Django-based web application designed for our calisthenics team. The platform serves as a centralized hub to showcase team member profiles and maintain a **scoreboard** for the most impressive **weighted Dips** and **Pull-ups** achievements. The app ensures smooth functionality for managing users and their performance records while supporting add, edit, and delete actions with proper permissions.

- **Permission-Based Editing**: Ensure that only authorized users can add, edit, or delete data in the scoreboard.
- **Stability & Scalability**: Build a reliable, extensible application for future enhancements.
